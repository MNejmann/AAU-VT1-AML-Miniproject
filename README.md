Mini project demonstrating binary and multiclass classification on the "Steel Plates Faults" dataset.


## Code
The code are created in jupitynotebook format, and are divided in to different files:
- binary_classification.ipynb
  - In the binary case, the classes are consided as following: "Pastry", "Z_Scratch", "K_Scatch", "Stains", "Dirtiness", and "Bumps" vs "Other_Faults".
  - The model used to predict between the two classes are logistical regression

- multiclass_classification.ipynb
  - In the multi-class case all the classes are can be predicted, here the k-nearest neighbor model is used to predict.


## Gihub folders
- "Images" - contains the images used in the report
- "steel+plates+faults" has the dataset from which origins from: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/198/steel+plates+faults
